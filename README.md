## xBurp & xReport

**xBurp** and **xReport** are lightweight Python-based BurpSuite extensions designed to automate key scanning and reporting functions. Built specifically for use with [Sec-Sci AutoPT](https://www.security-science.com/sec-sci-autopt) framework, these tools streamline the penetration testing workflow by automating security scan monitoring, exporting report, and BurpSuite shutdown.


## Features

### xBurp
- Monitors BurpSuite's active scan status
- Automatically closes Burp once all scans are complete

### xReport
- Exports Burp's scan issues in:
  - HTML format
  - XML format
  - Or both, based on user selection


## Prerequisites

Before installing these extensions, ensure the following:

3. Save the file, e.g., `jython-standalone-2.7.4.jar`, to a known location.

### 2. Enable Python Support in BurpSuite

1. Open **BurpSuite**
2. Navigate to **Extender** → **Options**
3. Scroll to **Python Environment**
4. Click **Select file…**
5. Choose the download file (e.g., `jython-standalone-2.7.4.jar`)

### 3. Load the Extensions into BurpSuite

1. Download [ [zip](https://github.com/securityscience/SecSci-xBurp-xReport/zipball/main) | [tar](https://github.com/securityscience/SecSci-xBurp-xReport/tarball/main) ] xBurp and xReport
   - Unzip the download `xBurp-xReport.zip` file
   - MD5 hash: `67f74736cc500e1d2bd017bbb22d27fe`
2. Go to **Extender** → **Extensions**
3. Click **Add**
4. Set:
   - **Extension Type**: Python
   - **Extension File**: `xBurp.py`
5. Click **Next** → then **Finish**
6. Repeat step 3 for `xReport.py`


## Usage Instructions

### xBurp

- Load `xBurp.py` into BurpSuite
- Run active scans as usual
- xBurp will monitor the scanning queue and gracefully shuts down Burp once all scans complete

### xReport

- Load `xReport.py` into BurpSuite
- Choose export format (HTML, XML, or both)
- Reports will be generated in the configured output directory upon invocation


## Troubleshooting

| Issue                             | Solution                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Extension fails to load          | Make sure you’re using Python 2.7 syntax and Jython is set.                                               |
| Scan not detected by xBurp                  | Verify that the scan was initiated through Burp’s active scanner and that it appears in the scan queue.   |
| No output from xReport            | - Check that issues exist in the target scope.<br/>- Validate write permissions for the output directory. |
